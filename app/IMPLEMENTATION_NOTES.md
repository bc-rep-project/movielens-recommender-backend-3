# MovieLens Recommender Implementation Notes

## Dataset Loading and Thumbnails Issue Resolution

We've identified and resolved the issues with limited movie loading and missing thumbnails in the recommender system. Here's a summary of the changes made:

### 1. Pre-downloaded MovieLens Dataset

- The MovieLens dataset has been manually downloaded and extracted to:
  `backend/app/data/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small`
- This ensures the dataset is always available locally without requiring Google Cloud Storage credentials.

### 2. Updated Data Pipeline

- Modified `process.py` to prioritize using the local pre-downloaded dataset
- Implemented a cascading fallback mechanism:
  1. First checks the pre-downloaded extracted dataset
  2. Then checks any user-configured dataset directory
  3. Then looks for local zip files to extract
  4. Finally attempts to download from MovieLens directly if needed

### 3. Enhanced Database Initialization

- The `init_db.py` file is configured to load at least 1000 movies when using the full dataset.
- It will automatically use the optimized `process_movielens_data()` function.
- If the full dataset loading fails, it will fall back to the sample data (10 movies).

### 4. TMDB Poster Integration

- When the app starts, it will load the full MovieLens dataset and enrich it with poster images from TMDB.
- This provides thumbnails for most of the movies in the dataset.
- The TMDB API key has been pre-configured in the `.env` file.

## Expected Results

After these changes:
- The app should now load approximately 9,000+ movies from the MovieLens dataset
- Most movies should have poster thumbnails from TMDB
- Recommendations will be much more diverse given the larger dataset
- The app should work even without Google Cloud Storage credentials

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Movie Count Still Low**: Check MongoDB connection settings in `.env`
2. **Missing Thumbnails**: Ensure TMDB_API_KEY is correctly set in `.env`
3. **Slow Initial Load**: The first startup may take several minutes as it processes the full dataset and fetches posters
4. **Errors in Logs**: Look for specific error messages related to MongoDB connection or data processing

## Further Enhancements

Consider these future improvements:

1. Implement a dataset update scheduler to periodically refresh movie data
2. Add a progress indicator for initial data loading
3. Cache TMDB results to reduce API calls on subsequent startups
4. Implement a fallback poster image for movies without TMDB matches
